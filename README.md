# WTP-WebToApp
This tool allows you to create applications as website shortcuts for you, you can create shortcuts either in webview or in OIB (Open-in-browser) mode

# Specifications:
1-) Shortcuts created on Desktop

2-) Custom name and shortcut icon

3-) Feels like a local app in webview mode

4-) You have two mods to use

(I couldn't think of any others :D)

# Why?
1- Quickly access the sites you want without entering the browser

2- Quickly access the sites you want without writing the name of the website

3- No distraction in Webview mode (other materials of the browser)

4- PWA does not work on all sites

# Bugs
1- Login entries in Webview are NOT KEPT (That is, every time you open and close the shortcut, it starts again, I'm working on it, use it on sites that you occasionally enter or do not have to log in)

2- In rare cases, shortcuts may disappear on their own


# installation

Just clone the repo and:
"
https://github.com/Handsomeskull/WTP-WebToApp.git
cd WTP
python webtoapp.py
"
Done!
